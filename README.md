# Text Emoticon Keyboard


### Purpose

This is another older project of mine that needs to be updated. It was created right after Apple began allowing 3rd party keyboards. I enjoyed using the ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ frequently in conversation but there was never a good way to access it, so I created this app (3rd party keyboard).

The app features MANY different text-based emoticons that I found to be useful.

It can be found on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/text-emoticons-keyboard/id971878648) for download (for free!
